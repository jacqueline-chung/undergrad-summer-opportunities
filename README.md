### What is this?

This is a compilation of summer opportunities for US undergrads interested in tech/entrepreneurship/product management. As a member of NCWIT, SWE, and Rewriting the Code (all fantastic women in tech organizations!), I've been able to compile lots of resources for underrepresented groups in tech. Many of these resources are listed in the categories below.

I was inspired by [codebytere](https://github.com/codebytere/so-you-want-an-internship)'s summer internship listing, but I thought that undergrads might also want to know about remote opportunities or entrepeneurship opportunities.

Feel free to send a PR if you have any resources you want to add!

### Training Programs

These aren't necessarily internships in the traditional sense, but they will prepare you for future internships.

[Y Combinator Virtual Internship](https://www.insidesherpa.com/virtual-internships/prototype/oRMogWRHeewqHzA7u/College-students%3A-Learn-how-to-work-at-a-YC-startup-)

This program, based on real work, will teach you the skills you need to build web applications for top startups.

[Venture for America Fellowship](https://ventureforamerica.org/)

VFA is a two-year fellowship program for recent grads who want to work at a startup and create jobs in American cities. Fellows learn important startup skills at our five-week Training Camp, apply for jobs within our vetted company network, and work for two years as full-time, salaried employees in one of 18 cities. When Fellows are ready to start a company — be it two years after college or ten — VFA has the resources (like a crowdfunding competition, accelerator, and seed fund) to help make that dream a reality.

### MIT Opportunities

As an MIT student, I have more specific knowledge for my university, but I'm sure if you look up tech/entrepeneruship summer opportunities, there's similar ones at your university as well!

These include summer opportunities, as well as general funding opportunities for student-led startups.
